          Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an
          American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path
          integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum
          electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled
          liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he
          proposed the parton model.

            For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman
            received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian
            Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga. Feynman developed a widely used
            pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions
            describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known
            as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the
            best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading
            physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked
            the seventh greatest physicist of all time. He assisted in the
            development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a
            wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel
            that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his
            work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering
            the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of
            nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in
            theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology. Feynman
            was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures,
            including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty
            of Room at the Bottom and the three-volume publication of his
            undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also
            became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're
            Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?, and
            books written about him such as Tuva or Bust! by Ralph Leighton and the
            biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James
            Gleick.
